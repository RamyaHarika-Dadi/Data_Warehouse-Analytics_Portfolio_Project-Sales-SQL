üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Script - SQL Data Warehouse Project
=======================================================================================

üìå Purpose:
This script performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the final analytical layer (Gold Layer)  
of the SQL Data Warehouse. It helps uncover key insights, understand patterns, and validate  
data quality before reporting and BI.

‚úÖ The analysis includes:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Exploration: List all tables and columns to understand the database structure.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensions Exploration: Explore customer countries, genders, and product categories.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Date Exploration: Analyze order date ranges and customer age distribution.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Measures Exploration: Calculate core business metrics like total sales, quantity sold, average price, and total orders.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Magnitude Analysis: Group sales and customer counts by location, category, and demographics.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking Analysis: Use window functions to identify top and bottom products and customers.

üóÉÔ∏è Tables Used:
- gold.dim_customers: Cleaned customer data  
- gold.dim_products: Product metadata and hierarchy  
- gold.fact_sales: Sales fact table used for KPIs and aggregations

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS:
‚ö†Ô∏è This script is designed for data analysis only ‚Äî it does not modify any tables.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Results may vary if source data is updated or transformed.  
‚ö†Ô∏è For best use, execute queries section-by-section in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
