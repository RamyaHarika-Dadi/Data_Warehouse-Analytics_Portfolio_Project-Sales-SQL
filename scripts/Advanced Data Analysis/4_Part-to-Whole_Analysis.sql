Part-to-Whole Analysis (Proportional Analysis)
===============================================================================

üìå Purpose:
This analysis identifies how much each **product category** contributes  
to the **overall sales** by calculating proportional revenue share.  
It provides insight into which categories are driving the most value.

‚úÖ Key Analyses:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Total sales by product category  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Contribution of each category as a percentage of overall sales  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ranked output to show top contributors first

üõ†Ô∏è SQL Techniques Used:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions: `SUM() OVER()`
- Percentage calculations using `CAST()` and `ROUND()`

üóÉÔ∏è Tables Used:
- `gold.fact_sales`  
- `gold.dim_products`
